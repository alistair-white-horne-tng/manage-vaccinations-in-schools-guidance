We’re coming to ==location_name== on ==next_session_dates== to give the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine ==not_catch_up?? to pupils in Year 8==.

==catch_up??Our records show your child has not had their HPV vaccination. Pupils usually have this when they’re in Year 8.==

We would like your consent to vaccinate ==short_patient_name==. You can give this by filling in our online form (the link is below).  

## What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect boys and girls against cancers caused by HPV, including:

* cervical cancer
* some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
* some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active. Young people usually only need 1 dose.

## Talk to your child about what they want

We suggest you talk to ==short_patient_name== about the vaccination before you respond to us. 

Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations. Those who show [‘Gillick competence’](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children/#:~:text=Children%20under%20the%20age%20of,responsibility%20can%20consent%20for%20them) have the right to consent to vaccinations themselves. Our team may assess Gillick competence during vaccination sessions.
