Our team are coming back to ==location_name== on ==next_session_dates== to give the HPV vaccine.

If you want your child to be vaccinated, you need to give your consent.

## What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect against cancers caused by HPV, including:

* cervical cancer
* some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
* some cancers of the anal and genital areas

The HPV vaccine works best if itâ€™s given before young people become sexually active.
