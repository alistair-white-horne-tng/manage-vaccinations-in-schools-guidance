We wrote to you recently about a visit by a local health team to ==location_name== on ==next_session_dates==.

If you want your child to get the HPV vaccination, you need to give consent by ==consent_deadline==. 

If you've already responded to the consent request, you can ignore this message.

## What the vaccine is for 

The HPV vaccine helps protect against cancers caused by HPV, including:

* cervical cancer
* some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
* some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active.
